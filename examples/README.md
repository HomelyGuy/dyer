The folder [`example`] holds a few examples that show you how to use [`dyer`] integrated with [`dyer-cli`], and of course there are many explanations inside each example.

## How to Use

Make sure that [`rust`] and [`cargo`] are installed in your OS, then clone this repository with:
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/HomelyGuy/dyer.git
```
Run those examples with:
```
cd dyer 
cargo run --example simple-demo(or customized-demo)
```	

Note that the folder [`template`], as the name suggests, is a template [`dyer-cli`] created for illustration.
